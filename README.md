### Outcomes



To facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion in computer science, as an educator, I must provide an opportunity to learn about the history of computer science. History is an essential component of this course to understand what we must change as a society by using computer science as a tool. First, having female role models in the field is essential for students who might think that this field is essentially only for males. Having a class like this introductory class will help students feel welcome. In history, Computer Science also excluded students of color, and this is an excellent opportunity to provide all students with the opportunity to make their mark in the field.
