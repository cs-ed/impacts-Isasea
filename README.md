# Impacts on Society


Course Title: Introduction to Computer Science  Grades 7th-8th Graders 

This course is for middle school students who would like to learn more about computer science by taking an introductory course. The course aims to help students understand what computer science can do to benefit society. Students will learn how to collaborate and learn problem-solving skills by completing projects in class. The curriculum for this course is on problem-based learning in computer science. 

Projects in this course will allow students to collaborate and grow as computer scientists. In Computer Science, it is essential to focus on group work to bring the best in projects.


In this course, we will be focusing on block-based language, starting with Scratch and ending the second semester with Java. This course will focus on learning concepts that will help students learn how to apply the concepts learned in computer science in different ways in their lives

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Class Discussions are in class. After the research is complete, we will start class discussions. The class breaks apart into two different groups when class discussions occur.  

Reports:

Reports help this class with research about Computer Science. Researching about possible careers if you obtain a bachelor's in computer science will help students learn what possibilities are out there. Reports will also include group reports. 
Examples of prompts for reports 
What careers are possible with Computer Science? 
What new technologies have helped the medical field? Make sure this cites how Computer Science helped. 

Homework:

Homework assignments are set up on Schoology and appear in the calendar for our class. Homework is assigned in class and completed in class. Collaboration is encouraged. 
Examples of homework: 
Adding in binary.
Read a Computer Science Article and summarize what the article is talking about. 

Exams:

Exams are not multiple choice but are projects. Projects all include a rubric, and students get to have a conference before they start their projects. Projects will be conducted in groups of four and done in class. Projects are student-centered based on the interest of students. Each group will be given the same grade and will be changed depending on the tasks assigned. The goal is to have students work with different people in a group setting. 

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes



To facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion in computer science, as an educator, I must provide an opportunity to learn about the history of computer science. History is an essential component of this course to understand what we must change as a society by using computer science as a tool. First, having female role models in the field is essential for students who might think that this field is essentially only for males. Having a class like this introductory class will help students feel welcome. In history, Computer Science also excluded students of color, and this is an excellent opportunity to provide all students with the opportunity to make their mark in the field. 


Technology will be taking over the world in a couple of years, which means that education should be accessible to all. To make education accessible to others completing work in school is essential for my students. Having time to complete classwork is vital to fostering a community in class that helps one another.
